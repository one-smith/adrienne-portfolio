      Hello, my name is Adrienne Smith. I'm an aspiring web developer with a background in Family and Child Development. 
    </header>
    <section>I like doing practical things in life. I also love puzzles. I think coding combines those things in an interesting 
        and satisfying way. I like that at the end of my hard work, there is a product that people can use, which will hopefully 
        help them in some way.
        When I'm not coding I spend my time sewing my own clothes, reading adventure books from the turn of the century, swimming in 
        rivers, and learning to play music. </section>

        Quiz App <br>
        This app will generate 5 random multiple-choice trivia questions, keep track of score and progress through the quiz. When
        the quiz is done, the user will see their final score and they will be able to play again without having to reload the site.<br>
        This app was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. <br>
